# pong-do-ping
Simple Application for a Ping-Pong test.
Run the PongDoPing_Server.py script on your Server location and the PongDoPing_Client.py on your Client Location, passing the requested attributes(ServerIP and Server Region);

I used Server Region as a parameter to create the pingTimes file because the point what I was trying to prove is that we have different times for ping depending on the distance between out Client and our Server.
It's a really Basic/simple test, but it's nice to prove this with actual data.
